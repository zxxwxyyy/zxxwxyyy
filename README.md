**`A Cook 👨‍🍳`**

Hi there, welcome to my repository! I am a graduate student pursuing Integrated Design and Media at Tandon NYU. In addition to the knowledge I gained in school, I am passionate about Machine Learning with Tensorflow and Scikit-learn, and I enjoy spending my time exploring these topics. You may find some of the code I've `cook` in this repository.
